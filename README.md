As you can see how easy it is to crack a small and simple password but if you use all leters, numbers and symbols and also a length of minimum 16, it will became hard to crack it.

Summary: This task provided a practical understanding of password security by allowing for the creation and testing of passwords with different characteristics. The evaluation process highlighted the importance of incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, as well as maintaining a sufficient length, to enhance password strength.
